# Wheel Collider Basic
 A very rudimentary replacement for Unity's Wheel Collider component.

 It is based off of the custom wheel collider built here:

 The Unity script, `Wheel`, provides a very basic simulation of a wheel suitable for vehicle physics.

 
 ## Script Parameters
 
 Here are some of the key parameters you can configure:
 
 - `mass`: The mass of the wheel.
 - `radius`: The radius of the wheel.
 - `maxSpeed`: Maximum speed the wheel can simulate.
 - `motorTorque`: The torque provided by the vehicle's motor.
 - `brakeTorque`: The torque applied when the vehicle brakes.
 - `tireGripFactor`: Factor that influences how much grip the tires have.
 - `suspensionRestDist`: The resting distance of the suspension.
 - `springStrength`: The strength of the suspension's spring.
 - `springDamper`: Damping factor of the suspension's spring.
